# British Airways Customer Review Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews of British Airways flights to gain insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and understand key factors influencing the customer experience. The analysis is performed using Python in Google Colab and visualized using Power BI.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is "British_Airway_Review.csv", containing customer reviews collected from [mention the source of the data, if available].

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame in Google Colab. Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the structure, data types, missing values, and distributions of key variables.
2. **Data Analysis:** In-depth analysis is conducted to identify potential outliers and relationships between variables. This includes analyzing star ratings, review length, recommendation status, and other relevant features.
3. **Data Visualization:** The data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Google Colab to gain insights into the distributions of key variables and identify potential relationships. Visualizations include histograms, box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
4. **Power BI Dashboard:** The processed data is exported to a CSV file and imported into Power BI Desktop to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard includes visualizations such as star rating distribution, recommendation breakdown, review length analysis, sentiment analysis, trends over time, and relationships between variables.
